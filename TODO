- File structure has been re-ordered but there is still a fundamental bug with how the program reads a set of sentences and checks for cognates
- Fix HTML highlighting bug
- Data structures are passed in very confusing ways, make a set of clear standards for what data types each function should take. Add some abstraction to make the code cleaner
- Improve interface.
- The sentences should gradually get harder
- Use multilingual embeddings to speed up translation process
- Make translations more permissive, so fewer false negatives

- Fundamental code structure is now working, but need to speed it up a lot:
- Optimization techniques:
    1) Use LLM to generate sentences or pull them from Dictionary site
    2) Speed up cognate detection using word embeddings, not dictionary lookup
